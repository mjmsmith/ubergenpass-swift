    <h3>Master Password</h3>
    <p>Type your SuperGenPass master password into the <b>Master Password</b> text field. When the text entered matches your current master password, the status indicator to the right of the Master Password label changes to green. Tap <b>Done</b> to continue.

    <h3>Save Recent Sites</h3>
    <p>If you enable <b>Save Recent Sites</b>, UberGenPass keeps a list of recent sites for which a password has been generated. These sites are used to populate a suggestion list that updates as you type a site name. Recent sites are stored in the secure iOS Keychain and cleared when you disable the feature.</p>

    <h3>Use Touch ID</h3>
    <p>When you relaunch UberGenPass after it's been running in the background, it will ask for your master password again.  If you enable <b>Use Touch ID</b>, you can unlock the app with your fingerprint. Note that this setting only applies after you've entered your master password at least once.</p>

    <h3>Background Timeout</h3>
    <p>The <b>Background Timeout</b> setting determines how long UberGenPass can be running in the background before asking for your master password again when relaunched. By default, this is set to the most secure option, "immediately". You can optionally suppress this for up to five minutes.</p>
