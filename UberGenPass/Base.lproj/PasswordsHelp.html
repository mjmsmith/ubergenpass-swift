    <h3>Master Password</h3>
    <p>Type your SuperGenPass master password into the two <b>Master Password</b> text fields. The status indicator to the right of the Master Password label changes color as you type. Green <img class="status" src="../GreenStatus.png"> indicates that the two passwords match. Red <img class="status" src="../RedStatus.png"> indicates that one or more characters do not match. Yellow <img class="status" src="../YellowStatus.png"> indicates that the fields match so far, but one field is shorter than the other.</p>

    <h3>Secret Password</h3>
    <p>To set an optional secret password, type it into the two <b>Secret Password</b> fields.  The status indicators behave as described above.  When the status indicators are green, tap <b>Done</b> to confirm your settings.</p>

    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>If you've enabled <b>Authenticate With Touch ID: On Launch</b>, UberGenPass stores your master password in the secure iOS Keychain.  Otherwise, it stores only a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2">SHA-256 hash</a> of your master password in the Keychain.</p>
    <p>If you've set a secret password, it's also stored in the Keychain, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES-256 encrypted</a> using the master password.</p>
